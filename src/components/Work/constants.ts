              <p><strong>Evolving Use Cases:</strong> Initially designed for streamers, StreamYard now accommodates streaming, recording, and webinars. This expansion isn't fully mirrored in the app’s current design, leading to a disconnect with user expectations and needs.</p>
              <p><strong>Increased Complexity:</strong> Introducing new features has enriched but unintentionally complicated the product, making it harder for new users to navigate and fully utilise its functionalities.</p>
              <p><strong>User Engagement Decline:</strong> Although enhancements like the Google login have boosted sign-ups by nearly 10%, there’s been a drop in new user broadcasts, a critical metric for assessing long-term engagement, indicating the post-sign-up flows aren’t fully optimised.</p>
              <p><strong>User Experience Issues:</strong> Observing new users through Fullstory sessions has revealed usability barriers, hesitation or confusion within the Dashboard and Studio, which harms engagement.</p>

              <p><strong>New use cases:</strong> StreamYard’s features evolved to serve streamers, podcasters, and webinar hosts, but the product user journey has been unchanged. We had to understand, why people are here to offer them a tailored to their needs experience. Looking at product surveys and user interview insights from our research team, the podcasting and webinar features weren’t apparent to our users. SY was well-known as a streaming platform and nothing more.</p>

              <p>A bold decision was to remove the skip button, forcing people to answer the question before diving into the product. I wasn’t a fan of this approach, but I agreed to release this to 20% of new users to gauge drop-off rates.</p>

              <p>The initial test maintained our original drop-off rate while empowering us with knowledge. To reduce drop-off, we reintroduced the “Skip” button, which worked well but led to fewer answers.</p>

              <p>The refined onboarding question helped segment users more effectively, revealing the detailed split between live streamers, recorders and webinar hosts. This data will measure use case swifts and trends and help us understand how different users onboard, retain or upgrade. It will also act as the foundation for delivering a tailored use case-based experience in the future.</p>
