              <p><strong>Evolving Use Cases:</strong> Initially designed for streamers, StreamYard now accommodates streaming, recording, and webinars. This expansion isn't fully mirrored in the app’s current design, leading to a disconnect with user expectations and needs.</p>
              <p><strong>Increased Complexity:</strong> Introducing new features has enriched but unintentionally complicated the product, making it harder for new users to navigate and fully utilise its functionalities.</p>
              <p><strong>User Engagement Decline:</strong> Although enhancements like the Google login have boosted sign-ups by nearly 10%, there’s been a drop in new user broadcasts, a critical metric for assessing long-term engagement, indicating the post-sign-up flows aren’t fully optimised.</p>
              <p><strong>User Experience Issues:</strong> Observing new users through Fullstory sessions has revealed usability barriers, hesitation or confusion within the Dashboard and Studio, which harms engagement.</p>
